
# Supercollider package for Sublime Text 2

This Sublime Text package is based on Geoffroy Montel's package (https://github.com/geoffroymontel/supercollider-package-for-sublime-text) and using lots of the goodies Arthur Carabot put into his fork (https://github.com/acarabott/supercollider-tmbundle). 

However, neither of those served my work practices (and key shortcuts) and I believe I have improved the syntax highlighting. 

## Installation
- Open Sublime Text 2  
- Go to Preferences/Browse Packages  
- Create a SuperCollider directory
- Drag the files from this repository into it  
- Change the path to your SuperCollider in SuperCollider.sublime-settings
- Restart Sublime Text 2
- Tools > SuperCollider > Start SC-lang
