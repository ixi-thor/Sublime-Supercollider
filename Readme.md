# SuperCollider package for Sublime Text

This Sublime Text package is based on Geoffroy Montel's package (https://github.com/geoffroymontel/supercollider-package-for-sublime-text) and using lots of the goodies Arthur Carabot put into his fork (https://github.com/acarabott/supercollider-tmbundle). 

However, neither of those served my work practices (and key shortcuts) and I believe I have improved the syntax highlighting, bracket matching and a few other things.

## Installation
- Open Sublime Text 2  
- Go to Preferences/Browse Packages  
- Create a SuperCollider directory
- Drag the files from this repository into it  
- Change the path to your SuperCollider installation in SuperCollider.sublime-settings (so Sublime can find the language and the synth)
- Restart Sublime Text 2
- Tools > SuperCollider > Start SC-lang

## Tips
- Use Shift+double click to select nearest matching bracket pair
- Use Command+shift+a to select nearest matching bracket pair

## TODO
- Port this to Windows and Linux
